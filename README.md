## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### About Me
I am an application developer as known as a "Generalist" at small start-up in Seoul.
I was jumped in to start-up swamp since 2014.
My work experiences; Native Frameworks (Android SDK and iOS SDK)/Flutter for make Mobile/Desktop/Web application, Flask/Spring boot/Ktor for make Server-side application, Python scripting for various messy automation jobs and various chip-specific frameworks like STM32Cube, ESP-IDF, etc. for make embedded application firmware.

Also, I have many hobbies for my life; such as Military, Amateur Radio, playing base and more.

### My experiences
# TBD.
